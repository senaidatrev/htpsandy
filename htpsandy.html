      <h1><b>A true tale on "I was born this way" My Birth Chart</b></h1>
      <p><b>Sun: Leo</b></p>

In fact, they can keep a group of people hooked to their conversation for quite a long while.</p>
<p><b>Moon: Capricorn</b></p>
<p>With the moon in Capricorn, these individuals nurture a strong urge to be productive. Even when they are undergoing emotional troubles, from the outside they appear to be calm and composed. These people are efficient and set practical and realistic goals for themselves, and work hard to achieve them. They keep reviewing the situation and never take any undue risks. They love to play it safe in any given circumstance, and plan their strategies carefully. They will never show their emotional side, and project themselves as being totally in charge of a situation. They are prone to hide their inner softer side and wish to be perceived by others as being relaxed. They may sometimes give the impression that they are unemotional and cunning, but they are not like that in reality. They just don't like to wear their hearts on their sleeves, and like to be meticulous and competent. They understand their own shortcomings well and make an extra effort to overcome them. They have a strong need to be respected by others.</p>
<p><b>Rising: Scorpio</b></p>
<p>If you're a Scorpio rising, you may come off as mysterious, quiet, and alluring. It's not always a sexually charged charm, although it can be. Scorpios have a reputation for being the most sexual sign of the zodiac, so your inherent sensuality may intimidate others when they first meet you. Most of the time, there's so much going on behind that cool, pristine face that people want to know more and can't stay away. Rising Scorpios are intense, and you have your reasons. You've likely had some experiences that have caused you to put up your guard, especially if you have other Scorpio influences in your chart. This sign is ruled by both the warrior Mars, and Pluto, the lord of the underworld, which explains some of the intensity.</p>
<p><b>Mercury: Leo</b></p>
<p>When Mercury is expressed through the fire sign of Leo, the result is a personality aflame with passion. Often the Mercury Leo person commands attention and is a captivating speaker or performer.

Whatever draws the attention of Mercury in Leo spontaneously becomes the focus of great concentration at that very moment. While the focus lasts, such people can energize an idea and bring it to life through colorful language that inspires others, too.

Such personalities prefer the dramatic to the mundane, which is why they can be riveting speakers. The Mercury Leo excels at public speaking, performance, and in knowing how to win the hearts of others by "painting a picture." This personality type knows how to hold the spotlight, but needs to take care not to over-do it. Using humor and a sense of play softens the tendency to go over-the-top with a "me, me, me," ego-based style of communication.</p>
<p><b>Venus: Cancer</b></p>
<p>Matters of home and family are incredibly important to people with their Venus in Cancer. Cancer is the homebody of the zodiac, preferring low-key nights in to wild nights out. Your house is your sanctuary, and you prefer activities that pertain to it like cooking, gardening, or decorating. You are the ultimate domestic god or goddess! A home that feels safe and secure is essential, and you’ll do everything you can to protect your loved ones.

Because your home life is so important to you, love is serious business for you! You aren’t interested in flings or casual relationships -- you want a long-term partner you can build a family with. Love without emotional involvement isn’t fulfilling to you, so you seek out relationships where you can have a deep, heartfelt connection with the other person.

Despite wanting a close connection, you are often cautious in matters of the heart. When you’re wounded, it hurts you deeply and takes you a long time to get over it. This why you might seem to have a hard outer shell at first -- you need it to protect the sensitivity that exists beneath you surface. Once you let your guard down, you are a very loving and sentimental partner.

Being born with Venus in Cancer makes you a highly intuitive individual. You have the instinctual ability to pick up on what other people need well before they do, and then figure out ways to support and care for them accordingly. Your heightened sensitivity makes you very empathetic and compassionate, especially toward your closest loved ones. This can sometimes feel like a balancing act, as you can focus so much on the needs of others that you neglect your own.</p>
<p><b>Mars: Saggittarius</b></p>
<p>Mars in Sagittarius is motivated to cover great distances, always seeking what's at the edge of the horizon. There are great energy bursts with your Mars, but it comes in fits and starts.

Your Mars is mutable, so you're all about spreading the joy, making tracks and acting on hunches. This is a very instinctive Mars, for gut-level guidance about what's got potential. Having a mutable (changeable) Mars means you're flexible and spontaneous.</p>
<p><b>Jupiter: Cancer</b></p>
<p>You are emotionally savvy and have the ability to deeply process your connections and reactions to the people and moments around you.

You have a big, empathetic heart and a desire to make others feel cared for. Many of your loved ones turn to you for support and emotional advice. Not only are you willing to listen, you have a wonderful way of helping them process their feelings and working through their distress. This ability to nurture will create long-lasting relationships ... but be aware of those who depend on you too much and take advantage of your goodwill.

As someone with your Jupiter in Cancer, you have emotions -- and lots of them! You can lead a very fulfilling life if you remember to let yourself process your feelings before acting on them. With Jupiter lending its larger-than-life energy to Cancer, you could be prone to mood swings. Preventing yourself from overthinking things and learning how to let things go could help alleviate this.

You’re likely to thrive in a field that lets you use your Cancerian inclinations to benefit other people. Real estate, caregiving, or real estate are all industries that may be a fit for you. When you find an area that you know and feel comfortable in, you’ll be inspired to climb ladders and make a dynamic impact. This is also due to your need for security -- and those with natal Jupiter in Cancer usually have no problem attaining material success.</p>
<p><b>Saturn: Gemini</b></p>
<p>Your mind is your greatest asset -- and perhaps your greatest challenge! Being born with Saturn in Gemini, you’ve got a keen ability to articulate information, solve problems, and handle details. Your mind overpowers your heart and you prefer to stick to facts over feelings. This makes you especially business savvy, as you are able to work easily with a vast amount of information that would be overwhelming to others.

The problem is, while your confidence in a data-driven world is very strong, your confidence in yourself is probably lacking. People with Saturn in Gemini often struggle with self-doubt. When you see so many paths of learning and opportunity, it can actually cause you to clam up and become very unsure of which is the right or best path. Once you start dwelling on this doubt mentally, it creates a fear within you that prevents you from moving forward. You may have an especially hard time in a school setting or in keeping a job long-term.

As always with Saturn, however, these difficulties are meant to guide you. Instead of letting a lack of confidence stop you in your tracks, you’re being called upon to consider ways to overcome your doubt and to find a way around your fears, in order to help you grow. Things change -- always -- and expecting to select one path and walk it for the rest of your life isn’t realistic. Try to embrace Gemini’s flexible attitude and realize that sometimes there is more than one answer, and that it’s OK to experiment. In fact, experimenting and trying multiple paths is a very effective method of learning -- something Saturn and Gemini can both appreciate and reward.</p>
<p><b>Uranus: Aquarius</b></p>
<p>The transit of the rebellious planet Uranus through Aquarius is profoundly impactful. It is about the birth of new ways of communicating, networking, and integrating with society. But it is also about the falling away of the old ways of doing things. When these two pair up, we should be ready to move and change along with these currents, lest we feel lost in the chaos they stir up.

Uranus in Aquarius is a fantastic time to take an interest in group dynamics. The interplay between the individual and groups will flourish during this cycle. The independence of Uranus paired with the grand thinking of Aquarius encourages us to take responsibility for our own lives. Simultaneously, this combo pushes us to embrace what we can do to improve the lives of others and the world in which we live.

Now is the time for us to develop the skills to work collaboratively. This sort of interconnected effort and support is vital with Uranus in Aquarius. Humanitarian endeavors will be lifted up and can gain immense momentum. If we donate our time to something we believe in, Uranus in Aquarius creates just the right atmosphere for our efforts to be amplified and truly make a difference.</p>
<p><b>Neptune: Aquarius</b></p>
<p>If you were born with Neptune in Aquarius, your subconscious mind is intermingled with your connections with others. This is an interesting combination that can manifest in intriguing ways.

Neptune offers you easy access to your internal realms. You may instantaneously know things about people that you can’t explain. You may also have strong intuitive abilities around others’ intentions. Learn to trust yourself. If something feels wrong, leave it ... if it feels right, dive in. Your Neptune in Aquarius grants you a deep sense of knowing that goes beyond what your mind can explain.

Take care to cultivate discernment as well, because you may also have the tendency to slip into a fantasyland in social situations. Practice methods of grounding yourself, or you may crash back to a harsh reality when you least expect it. Luckily, with Neptune in Aquarius, your friends are an integral part of this process, and chatting with them about your hopes and dreams regularly can provide vital and grounding reality-checks.</p>
<p><b>Pluto: Sagittarius</b></p>
<p>With your Pluto in Sagittarius, you are likely interested in philosophy and love talking about how shifts in our beliefs can make the world a better place. Confidence emanates from your very being and you attract all sorts of people to you. Your optimism and drive to live your personal truth, coupled with the wisdom afforded someone who knows the depths of their own soul, makes you admired by others and comfortable taking the reins in social situations.

Take care to stay connected to the experiences of others, however. With such natural clarity, it is easy for you to slip into feelings of superiority or frustration with others for not being on what you feel is “your level.” Remember, we are all on our own journey and we all have our own lessons to learn and to teach. Stay compassionate, stay kind, and stay humble. Everything in your life will benefit.</p>
<p><b>North Node: Cancer</b></p>
<p> "If you have your north node in Cancer, you’ve been going through your nodal axis return for the past year, which means you might have fated, destined encounters and events," Lang says. "The Cancer north node feels an internal tug-of-war between family and career. They are here to have an experience of nesting, creating a home base for their loved ones. Theirs is a life about family."</p>
